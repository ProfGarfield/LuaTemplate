--  
--  Registers a function to be called every time a city calculates its total resource yield. Input is the city, and the food, shields and trade of its tiles. Returns a 5-tuple of modifiers, food change, shield change before waste, shield change after waste, trade change before corruption, trade change after corruption. These modifiers are applied at the following points in the calculation:
--  Calculate yield from all worked tiles
--  Run onCalculateCityYield
--  Add foodChange, shieldChangeBeforeWaste and tradeChangeBeforeCorruption
--  Add changes from food trade routes
--  Add shields from improvements
--  Calculate and subtract waste
--  Calculate corruption and add changes from commodity trade routes
--  Calculate corruption again (now using the value after trade routes) and subtract.
--  Add shieldChangeAfterWaste and tradeChangeAfterCorruption
--  Calculate Tax/Lux/Sci
